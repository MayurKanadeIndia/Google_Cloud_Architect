# What is cloud?

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (for example, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

### GCP Locations

GCP has a global footprint that includes North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The locations are further split into regions and zones.
It is your decision where your application should be located to provide low latency and high availability.

It should also be noted that not all services are available in each region

### Resource Manager

- GCP consists of containers such as organizations, folders, and projects to hierarchically group your resources.
- The resources can be managed programmatically using APIs. Also, Google provides tools such as Google Cloud Console and command-line utilities, which are wrappers around the API calls.
